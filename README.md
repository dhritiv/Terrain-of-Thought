# Terrain of Thought
Rosehacks 2023 Project

Who here has ever made a to-do list? Of course we all have! However, on many occasions, we find that our to-do list looks like this (shows a long ass list of things to-do) For many, a list this long can be overwhelming to look at. It’s stress-inducing seeing the large amount of work you have left, and chances are, it is left incomplete and you are left unsatisfied. Often, our to-do lists can be unrealistic for a single day's work as well! 

Our project encourages our users to think of their top five priorities to put on their list and offers another form of satisfaction and achievement for completing their tasks. At the beginning, you will find that the environment around your to-do list is gross and dirty, but as you continue going about your schedule and checking items off your list, it will slowly get cleaner and cleaner. Ultimately, when all items on your list are completed, users are greeted by a calm and peaceful scenery. Combining realistic goal setting and an alternate motivation for completing said goals, users of our project will find that they feel less overwhelmed from the traditional paper to-do list and an increased work productivity. The backgrounds also raise awareness about the damage we are currently causing the environment. So when you’re having a tough time, remember that all you need is to use your Terrain of Thought .
